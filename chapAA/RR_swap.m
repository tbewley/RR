function [b,a]=RR_swap(a,b)
% function [b,a]=RR_swap(a,b)
% A curiously simple (empty!) function that simply swaps the (entire) contents of a and b.
% INPUTS:  a=a matlab object containing pretty much anything
%          b=another matlab object containing pretty much anything
% OUTPUTS: first output argument = whatever b had on input   SEE EXAMPLE USEAGE BELOW!!
%          second output argument = whatever a had on input
% TEST:    a=randn, b=randn(2), [a,b]=RR_Swap(a,b); a, b
